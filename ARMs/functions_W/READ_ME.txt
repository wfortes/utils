cgls_W.m is a version of cgls.m

lsqr_W makes use of iterapp_W.m and iterchk_W.m.

iterapp.m and iterchk.m are matlab functions containing some errors in an old matlab version.
iterapp_W.m and iterchk_W.m are modified versions of iterapp.m and iterchk.m, respectively.
Perhaps new versions are fixed.
